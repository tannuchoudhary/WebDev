## attributes
Everything that is colored with orange in an atom are attribute, i.e everyhting that goes inside the tag other than the tag name itself is an attribute. e.g class, href etc.

to manipulate the attribute we have methods:

```javascript
  document.querySelector("a");
```
output: it will give you the anchor tag present in code
```javascript
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
```
```javascript
document.querySelector("a").attributes;
```
output: it will give you the list of attributes present in anchor tag
```javascript
NamedNodeMapÂ {0: href, href: href, length: 1}
```
here there is only one attribute inside anchor tag and that is href

Now we can get the value of attribute by using method getAttribute("name of attrirbute");
Note: attribute will be singular here, not plural
```javascript
document.querySelector("a").getAttribute("href");
```
it will give the link of google here as we arepointing towards the google

Now you can change this attribute using setAttribute("name of agttribute", "in which you want to change");
```javascript
document.querySelector("a").setAttribute("href", "https://www.bing.com");
```
and we are done, still it will show google as inner html is google, but it will redirect you to bing.com
