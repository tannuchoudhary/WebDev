```javascript
function BellBoy(name, age, hasWorkPermit, languages){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.hasWorkPermit = hasWorkPermit;
        this.languages = languages;
        //now we can see that we are initialising a function inside our constructor i.e method associated to our housekeeper function
        this.cleanRoom = function(){
            alert("room cleaning in progress...");
           
    }
}
```
now create the object using this
```javascript
var bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("tin", "21", "true", ["english", "french"]);
```
and then you can call the method cleanRoom using dot operator like this

```javascript
bellBoy1.cleanRoom();
```

we can see that the above syntax is same as the syntax we used to play our audio, i.e this 
```javascript
var audio = new Audio('sounds/crash.mp3');
         audio.play();
```
we have created the new method Audio and stored it in audio and then called the method using dot operator
