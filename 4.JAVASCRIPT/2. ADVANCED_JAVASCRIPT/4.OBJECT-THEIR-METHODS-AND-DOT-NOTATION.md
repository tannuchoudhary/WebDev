```javascript
function BellBoy(name, age, hasWorkPermit, languages){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.hasWorkPermit = hasWorkPermit;
        this.languages = languages;
        //now we can see that we are initialising a function inside our constructor i.e method associated to our housekeeper function
        this.cleanRoom = function(){
            alert("room cleaning in progress...");
           
    }
}
```
now create the object using this
```javascript
var bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("tin", "21", "true", ["english", "french"]);
```
and then you can call the method cleanRoom using dot operator like this

```javascript
bellBoy1.cleanRoom();
```

we can see that the above syntax is same as the syntax we used to play our audio, i.e this 
```javascript
var audio = new Audio('sounds/crash.mp3');
         audio.play();
```
we have created the new method Audio and stored it in audio and then called the method using dot operator
 
 So we dan analyze that the constructor function of this audio might look like this
 ```javascript
 function Audio(fileLocation){
        this.fileLocation = fileLocation;
        this.play = function(){
                //Tap into the audio hardware
                //check the file at file location exists
                //check the file at fileLocation is a sound file
                //play the file at fileLocation
        }
 }
 ```
 we have just assumed that the constructor for playing audio might have been looking like this, and we can see that it made our work so easier, we just have to call the method of the constructor to play the sound using dot operator and the whole work will be done, as lot of the properties and methods are predefined in the javascript
 
 And sometimes you will need to create your own object to give the custom behaviour to the website
