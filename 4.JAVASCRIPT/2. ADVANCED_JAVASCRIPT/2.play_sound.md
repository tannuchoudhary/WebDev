* To play an audio with the help of javascript

```javascript
var audio = new Audio('tannu-music.mp3');
        audio.play();
```
the syntax is

```
mySound = new Audio([URL string]);
```
* As now we want to assign different sounds to different buttons
* for that we need to know that which button got clicked
* so we will use "this", "this" will give you the identity of the button that triggered the event listener
* "this" attaches the event listener which gets attached to the elements when we call it
* here "this"  attached the event listener to all the buttons, when when we will trigger that it will give you the class associated with it
```javascript
console.log(this); 
```

* Now we can change properties of HTML and CSS using "this" keyword

```javascript
console.log(this.innerHTML); 
```
* task : change the color of innerHTML of button to white when clicked
```javascript
        var numberOfDrumButtons = document.querySelectorAll(".drum").length; //this  will select all those having    class drum and will return the length
        for(var i=0; i<numberOfDrumButtons; i++){ //used limit as numberOfDrumButtons instead of number 7 so that later if we would want to add more drums
            document.querySelectorAll(".drum")[i].addEventListener("click", function(){ //use class drums in place of buttons to being more specific
                console.log(this.style.color = "white");
            });
        }
```
