* Now we will learn how to use keyboards to trigger the sound of drums instead of pressing the button on screen

* we have to listen to keydown event to hear the key press
* and will tell if any button is pressed or not
* the event names are small letters, take a look at the MDN doc
* Now what exactly do we add event listener to, as previously we added our event listener to all of the buttons, so when the buttons get pressed then the event listener gets triggered
* but in this case we are waiting for the keyboard keys, so how can we addd event listener to the keyboard
* actually, you don't have to, just add the event listener to entire document so the entire document starts listening to the keyboard strokes 
```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(){alert("key was pressed");});
```
so what is happening here, when we add an event listener to an element then once the event happens, the element will trigger the function that's in the second parameter.
So in this case when a key press is detected it will trigger the function that tells the browser to show an alert.

Now when that function gets triggered There's also the option to pass in a parameter, somehting like this

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event){
  alert("key was pressed");
});
```
and when we will do sonsole.log(event) it will give you the details that which key got pressed and all the other details about it
