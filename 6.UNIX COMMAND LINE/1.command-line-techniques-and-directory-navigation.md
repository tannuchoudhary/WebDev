  * To navigate one level down, i.e, you want to navigate inside the directory in which currently you are. for e.g, right now I am in my home directory(which is default in terminal) and I want to go inside the Document directory which is inside home directory then I have to write ``` cd Documents/ ``` or you can just write ``` cd Doc ``` and press ``` tab ``` and autosuggest will complete it, you have to write one or two letter for the autosuggest to complete or if there are two or more than two directories or files in that particular directory of same prefix then autosuggest will list out all of them and will ask you to choose.
