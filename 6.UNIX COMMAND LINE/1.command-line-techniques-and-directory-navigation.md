  * To navigate to a different directory, you have to use ``` cd ``` command i.e change directory command
  * To navigate one level down, i.e, you want to navigate inside the directory in which currently you are. for e.g, right now I am in my home directory(which is default in terminal) and I want to go inside the Document directory which is inside home directory then I have to write ``` cd Documents/ ``` or you can just write ``` cd Doc ``` and press ``` tab ``` and autosuggest will complete it, you have to write one or two letter for the autosuggest to complete or if there are two or more than two directories or files in that particular directory of same prefix then autosuggest will list out all of them and will ask you to choose.

  * To navigate directly to the root directory ``` cd ~ ```( ~ is called tilde)
  
  * To directlt navigate to the particular directory, write the whole path after cd, e.g, ``` cd /home/tannu/Pictures/Webcam ``` this will take you to the webcam folder directly
  * Also if you don't want to write the whole path you can just write ``` cd ``` and drag and drop the folder in the terminal, the whole path will get automatically written.
