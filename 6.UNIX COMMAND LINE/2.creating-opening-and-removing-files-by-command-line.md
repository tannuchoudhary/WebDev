* If you want to create directory, let us say named books then ``` mkdir books ```
* Now I want to create a file inside the folder books called Bhagvad-Geeta, then do ``` touch Bhagvad-Geeta.txt ```
* Now to open any file, you need to navigate to it's location and write ``` open Bhagvad-Geeta.txt ```
* Now I can also specify, using which application I want to open my file ``` open -a Atom Bhagvad-Geeta.txt ```, this will open the text in Atom
