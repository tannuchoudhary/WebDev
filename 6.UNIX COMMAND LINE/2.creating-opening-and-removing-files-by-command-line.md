# With great power comes great responsibility
* If you want to create directory, let us say named books then ``` mkdir books ```
* Now I want to create a file inside the folder books called Bhagvad-Geeta, then do ``` touch Bhagvad-Geeta.txt ```
* (windows)Now to open any file, you need to navigate to it's location and write ``` start Bhagvad-Geeta.txt ```
* (windows)Now I can also specify, using which application I want to open my file ``` start -a Atom Bhagvad-Geeta.txt ```, this will open the text in Atom
* If you want to delete(remove) files ``` rm Bhagvad-Geeta.txt ```
* If you want to delete(remove) all files inside a folder ``` rm * ``` (with great power comes great responsibility) so be careful while using this command, because let say you are not inside the directory which you want to delete, let us say you are in root directory then every file will be deleted and this process is not reversible, but folders will not be deleted as there is different command to delete folders. so always check which location you are in before using these destructive commands.
* To remove a directory you have to use extra -r i.e for e.g you want to delete folder called books then do like this ``` rm -r books/ ``` now this will delete the directory book and all the files and folders which are inside it i.e all it's child components.
* sudo means super user do which uses your admin previliges to allow you to do things which are probably little bit dangerous 
* ``` sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root/ ``` here ``` sudo ``` is super user do, ``` rm ``` is for removing after that ``` -r ``` is for deleting directory and along with that ``` f ``` flag which stands for force which means it will not ask for confirmation and then ``` --no-preserve-root/ ``` which means it is going to wipe your hard disk and recovery will not be possible.
