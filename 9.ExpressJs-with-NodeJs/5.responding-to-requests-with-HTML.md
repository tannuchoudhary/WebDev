Now we'll build calculator, we'll build calculator using all the prior knowledge, we get to use the data that gets entered into the forms and perform calculations on it in our server.
First of all we'll create a html file inside the calculator folder, use ``` touch index.html ``` to create a file and then open it in atom and write the boilerplate code using shortcut, give the title as calculator and then create a form in which you have to take input for two numbers and create one submit button.

After creating the HTML file i.e now that we've created our buttons and our form we're going to send this entire HTML file when the browser tries to access the home route in the calculator.js file.
So we can see that we have used get() method to access the home route and inside that we were using res.send() which is sending individual bits of data but here we want to send the entire web page i.e our html file so we have to head over to the documentation of the express at ``` expressjs.com ``` and go to ``` API reference ``` and then you can see that to send the whole file we can use ``` res.sendFile(path) ``` now you may have a doubt that, if you are sending the filename i.e ``` index.html ``` inside the sendFile() method then how it is going to recognize the file, when you will not be in that directory or working on someone else's computer, so what you can do is, use this
``` res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html"); ``` i.e, (two underscores and dirname) __dirname will fetch the current path and then concatenate the name of file which you wnat to send in js file, now this woould provide a path to reach that file


* you can also save the path in the other file if __dirname is creating confusion for you and then you can send the location of that file in the js getFile method and concatenate your current file name, both will work same.

Now when we'll head over to the ``` localhost:3000 ``` and give two numbers and click on calculate, then we can see that the page does not give the result and prints the error ``` Cannot POST /index.html ```.
Now we can see in our html code that form has an action and a method,now method is the post method, so we are sending our data to somewhere i.e to the index.html as action is assigned with ``` index.html ``` but we want to send the data to the server, so it should be assigned as the root directory or you can just delete the action part then it will by default send the data to the server
so you can keep it as 
```html
<form action="/" method="post">
  .......
</form>
``` 
or you can remove action from the form
```html
<form method="post">
  .....
</form>
```
