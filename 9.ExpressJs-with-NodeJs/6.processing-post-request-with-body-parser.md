* Now when we'll head over to the ``` localhost:3000 ``` and give two numbers and click on calculate, then we can see that the page does not give the result and prints the error ``` Cannot POST /index.html ```.
Now we can see in our html code that form has an action and a method,now method is the post method, so we are sending our data to somewhere i.e to the index.html as action is assigned with ``` index.html ``` but we want to send the data to the server, so it should be assigned as the root directory or you can just delete the action part then it will by default send the data to the server
so you can keep it as 
```html
<form action="/" method="post">
  .......
</form>
``` 
or you can remove action from the form
```html
<form method="post">
  .....
</form>
```
* Now if you will run the code, still you will get an error of 404, let us first understand HTTP return codes
    * 100 -> Hold on
    * 200 -> Here you go(everything is fine)
    * 300 -> go away(security issues)
    * 400 -> You screwed up(client error, user is trying to browse somehting which does not exist)
    * 500 -> I screwed up
    
So now what is the problem with our code, what is error 404 here, Well the problem is that a server does not have a way of processing any post requests. So we're basically not accepting anybody to post to our home route.
So let us fix the error, let us do something which wil help us to post on the home route

```javascript
//helps in posting something to the home page 
app.post("/", function(req, res){
    res.send("Thanks for posting that!");
});
```
* Now We need to be able to get the entered data into home, into this callback function so we can calculate the output and then send the result back to the browser. Now in order to tap into those pieces of data we have to install another NPM package which is called body processor.

``` npm install body parser ```
now you can see that this is added in the dependencies in the package.json, now what this will do, actually this will allow us to pass the information, now we have access to properties and variables so we can do our calculations and to use it in our javascript file we just need to require it.

require body-parser
```javascript
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
```
note: use camelCasing for variable and while requiring it, you have to use it's actual name(case sensitive)

So now that we've incorporated body parser into our project, the next step is to get our app to use it

```javascript
  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));
  ```

let us understand how we have written this, body parser works with Express so we'll write app.use and we're going to specify the thing we wanted to use which is body-parser now body-parser has a few modes, first one is ``` text ``` that means, pass all the requests into text, next is body-parser ``` json ``` which is the special format that we saw before, Which kind of looks a bit like javascript objects, and the third one which we are going to use is urlencoded. And this is the special one that we use when we're trying to pass data that comes from an html form.


So whenever we're trying to grab the information that gets posted to our server from an html form we're going to be using urlencoded.And in addition to that we're going to add an option called extended and we're going to set it to be true.And by setting that extended option to true that basically just allows us to post nested objects and it's not something that we're going to be using but it's something that body-parser is requiring us to explicitly declare.

So we have to write this piece of code everytime we'll be using body-parser


So by using body-parser we're able to pass the HTTP request that we get. And by using urlencoded, we can get access to the form data and we can then tap into each of these as if they were just properties of the object body, i.e we can use all the data in this case num1 and num2, just like they are the objects declared here.

```javascript
//helps in posting something to the home page
app.post("/", function(req, res){
    var num1 = Number(req.body.num1);
    var num2 = Number(req.body.num2);

    var result = num1 + num2;

    res.send("The result of the calculation is " + result);
});
```
note: don't forget to convert the number to integer,i.e typecast them into Number() as by default they are in string format

* Now when on your page ``` localhost:3000 ``` when you'll double click and go to the source of the page then you can see that, only html code will be shown and all the javascript codes which were used to make this calculator are hidden.

* All of that is hidden and taken away from the client side because we're doing it on our server.And this is all because we built a backend that is doing the code execution instead of having all of that javascript run on the front end which is on the client browser 
* We now have a web application, because our code is running on the backend as opposed to just simply having static files being rendered and loaded up and having javascript run on the client side or the front end.
