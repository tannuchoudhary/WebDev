* Now when we'll head over to the ``` localhost:3000 ``` and give two numbers and click on calculate, then we can see that the page does not give the result and prints the error ``` Cannot POST /index.html ```.
Now we can see in our html code that form has an action and a method,now method is the post method, so we are sending our data to somewhere i.e to the index.html as action is assigned with ``` index.html ``` but we want to send the data to the server, so it should be assigned as the root directory or you can just delete the action part then it will by default send the data to the server
so you can keep it as 
```html
<form action="/" method="post">
  .......
</form>
``` 
or you can remove action from the form
```html
<form method="post">
  .....
</form>
```
* Now if you will run the code, still you will get an error of 404, let us first understand HTTP return codes
    * 100 -> Hold on
    * 200 -> Here you go(everything is fine)
    * 300 -> go away(security issues)
    * 400 -> You screwed up(client error, user is trying to browse somehting which does not exist)
    * 500 -> I screwed up
