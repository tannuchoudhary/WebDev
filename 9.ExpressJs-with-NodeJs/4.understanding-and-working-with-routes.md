# Targeting the routes other than root("/")

## we'll learn how to create multiple page website by targeting all the routes in javascript file

* Let say I want to create new page for contact then just like I had the code for the home page, I have to write code for contact pages and in the first parameter, instead of passing ``` "/" ``` which represents root, we have to pass ``` "/contact" ```, let us see the code

```javascript
app.get("/contact", function(request, response){
    response.send("contact me at: tannu@gmail.com");
});
```

* And similarly I want to create a new page for about-me 

```javascript
app.get("/about-me", function(request, response){
    response.send("Hey, I am Tannu and I am a web developer.");
});
```
