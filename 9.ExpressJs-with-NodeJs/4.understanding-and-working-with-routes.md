# Targeting the routes other than root("/")

## we'll learn how to create multiple page website by targeting all the routes in javascript file

* Let say I want to create new page for contact then just like I had the code for the home page, I have to write code for contact pages and in the first parameter, instead of passing ``` "/" ``` which represents root, we have to pass ``` "/contact" ```, let us see the code

```javascript
app.get("/contact", function(req, res){
    response.send("contact me at: tannu@gmail.com");
});
```

* And similarly I want to create a new page for about-me 

```javascript
app.get("/about-me", function(req, res){
    response.send("Hey, I am Tannu and I am a web developer.");
});
```
Now you can go to your ``` localhost:3000 ``` and if you want to go to the contact page then go to ``` localhost:3000/contact" ``` and for the about-me page, go to the ``` localhost:3000/about-me ```

So you can set up basically as many routes as you wish and that means that you can start building up your Web site to have a lot of different pages.
We can see that this is much easier than when we were creating so many pages by relying on our HTML

* Now we can notice that each time we have to restart our server whenever we are making any changes in our code, so to save ourselves from this pain we can install nodemon using ``` npm install -g nodemon ```, now Now it doesn't matter where you install this, It doesn't have to be inside your package. It can be in your root or in your home directory. Once you've installed it, it will be available across all of your projects.

So install nodemon in your system and then whenever you are writting node.js code, for e.g the name of my js code is server.js so just write this in your terminal, just check first that you are in that directory in which this js file is and then write ``` nodemon server.js ```, now whenever you will update and save your code in atom then this will automatically start your server.
that means that my server is active and refreshed to the latest version of the code at all times. And I don't have to go through that painful process of cmd+c then restarting.
