Right now our server is not sending anything else back when our browser makes the get requests, get() is a method that's provided by express that allows us to specify what should happen when browser gets in touch with our server or makes a get request, the first parameter it takes is the location of the GET request. So when we type ```localhost:3000 ``` the GET request is being sent to the route of our Web site which is represented by a forward slash. Now when that get requests happens we can trigger a callback function and this callback function can have two parameters, request and response.

```javascript
const app = express();

app.get("/", function(request, response){
    console.log(request);
});
```

the first parameter takes the location i.e "/" represents the root or the home page and the second parameter, there's a callback function that tells the server what to do when that request happens, but still when we'll refresh our page we can see that there isn't any response but in terminal, all the requests are mentioned which were made during this process, now to get any response on our page, we can write html code inside the function.

```javascript
const app = express();

app.get("/", function(request, response){
    response.send("<h1>Hello world!</h1>");
});
```
the ``` request `` can be written as ``` req ``` in short and ``` response ``` can be written as ``` res ```
