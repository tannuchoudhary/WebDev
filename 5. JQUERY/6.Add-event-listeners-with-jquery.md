## Let us add event listener to our h1 element

```javascript
$("h1").click(function(){
  $("h1").css("color", "purple"); //this will change the color of h1 to purple when clicked
  });
```
for selecting all the four buttons in javascript we had to use for loop

```javascript
//this will change the color of h1 to purple if any of the button would be clicked
  for(var i=0; i<5; i++){
    document.querySelectorAll("button")[i].addEventListener("click", function(){
      document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "purple";
    });
  }
```
but  in jQuery, this is much easier, because we don't need for loop, jQuery will select for all button if we combine and if we combine it with click then it will add event listener for all the buttons when clicked
```javascript
  $("button").click(function(){
    $("h1").css("color", "purple");
  });
 ```
  ## listening to the key press using jQuery
  ```javascript
  $("input").keypress(function(event){
    console.log(event.key); //this will tell you which key is enetered in the input space of website and will print that key in console
  });
  ```
 if you want to know for the whole screen,just like we did in the drumkit project, then we have to listen to the whole document
 
 ```javascript
  $("body").keypress(function(event){ //you can write body for the whole body
    console.log(event.key);
  });
  ```
   or you can also write this as 
   
   ```javascript
  $(document).keypress(function(event){ //or the document by removing quotation marks
    console.log(event.key);
  });
  ```
