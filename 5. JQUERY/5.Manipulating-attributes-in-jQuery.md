 # Manipulate attributes using jQuery
 attributes e.g- src of image, href of anchor tag etc, we can get and set these attributes on the fly using jQuery,
 we have methods to do that
 
 ## get value of attribute
 ```javascript
 console.log($("img").attr("src")); //this is for image 
 ```
 ## set value of attribute
 The below will select all the anchor tags and will change it to yahoo.com
```javascript
 $("a").attr("href", "https://www.yahoo.com");
 ```
 we can aslo get the class of html attributes, for e.g we want to find out all the classes of h1 
 ```javascript
 console.log($("h1").attr("class"));
 ```
 this will give you the list of all the classes of the h1 attribute in console
