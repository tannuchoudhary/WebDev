```javascript
$("h1").text("Bye"); //this will change all the text in h1 of web page to Bye
```

```javascript
$("button").text("Don't clicke me"); //this will change all text in button to don't click me
```

We know that jQuery's $ sign selects all elements

Now, as we have studied earlier about the innerHTML, in jQuery you just have to write html, and we know that innerHTML not only changes the text but also changes the effect ie if you write 
```javascript
$("h1").text("<em>Bye</em>");
```
it will print all h1 as

```javascript
<em>Bye</em>
```
but if you'll use innderHTML which is just written as html in jQuery, then it will emhasize the text
```javascript
$("h1").html("<em>Bye</em>");
```
