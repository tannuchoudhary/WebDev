* we can manipulate our css i.e style by using jQuery by simply using the .css method from jQuery, something like this

  ```javascript
  $("h1").css("color", "green");
  ```
  this will change the color of h1 text to green

* Now this method is really flexible, For example you can get the current value of the CSS property by simply having
  the name of the property in some quotation marks as a string inside the method, And now we can console log the value
  of this, something like this.

  ```javascript
  console.log($("h1").css("color"));
  ```
  This will give the output int he form of rgb value i.e red, green, blue, i.e (0,0,0) in case of black.

* we can also get the font size using this
  ```javascript
  console.log($("h1").css("font-size"));
  ```
 * So in the css dot property method, if you have a single property in it then you're getting the value of it, And if
 you have two properties in it then you're setting the value.
 
 * but changing something that's related to the style inside our javascript code is not good, It feels a little bit dirty and that's because we need to separate our concerns keep our javascript code all about behavior keep all style code all about the appearance and keep HTML code all about content.
 
## add and remove class in jQuery

So to do that what we can do is, define a class in your css and you can define the properties inside it, whatever you want, for e.g

```css
//css code
.big-title{
  font-size: 10rem;
  color: yellow;
  font-family: cursive;
  }
```
Now add this in your javascript

```javascript
  //jquery code
  $("h1").addClass("big-title"); //add the class of css you want to add
```
this is a much better way of separating our behavior from our styles, now we can also remove this class by using remove method
```javascript
//jquery code
$("h1").removeClass("big-title");
```

## add and remove more than one class in jQuery

```css
//css code

//1st class
.big-title{
  font-size: 10rem;
  color: yellow;
  font-family: cursive;
 }
  
 //2nd class
  .margin-50{
    margin : 50px;
  }
```

add classes in jquery

```javascript
  //jquery code
  $("h1").addClass("big-title margin-50"); //add the classes of css you want to add using space in between them
```
## see whether or not the element has particular class in jquery, it will return boolean value
```javascript
  //jquery code
  $("h1").hasClass("margin-50");
```
