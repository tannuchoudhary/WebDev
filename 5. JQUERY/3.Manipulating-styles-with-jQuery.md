* we can manipulate our css i.e style by using jQuery by simply using the .css method from jQuery, something like this

  ```javascript
  $("h1").css("color", "green");
  ```
  this will change the color of h1 text to green

* Now this method is really flexible, For example you can get the current value of the CSS property by simply having
  the name of the property in some quotation marks as a string inside the method, And now we can console log the value
  of this, something like this.

  ```javascript
  console.log($("h1").css("color"));
  ```
  This will give the output int he form of rgb value i.e red, green, blue, i.e (0,0,0) in case of black.

* we can also get the font size using this
  ```javascript
  console.log($("h1").css("font-size"));
  ```
 * So in the css dot property method, if you have a single property in it then you're getting the value of it, And if
 you have two properties in it then you're setting the value.
 
 * but changing something that's related to the style inside our javascript code is not, It feels a little bit dirty and
  that's because we need to separate our concerns keep our javascript
