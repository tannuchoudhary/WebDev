* Node.js contains bunch of built in modules, which helps us to interact with computer directly and we can get access directly to the local files of the computer.

* head over to https://nodejs.org/api/index.html to see all the documentation of bundles and what it can do and how to use it.

* Now there's a whole bunch of methods and properties that you can tap into but in order to use the module we first have to require it
* to require the module of file system we need to declare constant variable, let us name it fs and then require it like this ``` const fs = require("fs"); ```
* Now atom will give you a warning, to remove that warning you can switch off these warnings just by commenting ``` //jshint esversion:6 ``` and this will tell the Linter that I'm actually using it's version 6 don't worry about the weird syntax.
* Now we have incorporated the file system in our project
* Now you can do so many things using file system like For example you can specify paths you can open files you can change files you can access and read and write to the local file system.

Now let us just use one of the methods of the file system i.e copying data from one file to another and if that file does not exists in your system then it will create it.
 * so first of all create a file ``` file1.txt ``` and then write something into it 
 * Now in atom -> in index.js write

``` javascript
  //jshint esversion:6
  
  const fs = require("fs");
  fs.copyFileSync("file1.txt", "file2.txt");
  
  ```
  Now run this in your terminal using ``` node index.js ``` , just make sure that your are in the directory in which the index.js is saved
  Now as we haven't created file2.txt so it will be created automatically and everything which is written in file1.txt will be copied to file2.txt
