# NPM 
* NPM stands for Node Package Manager, is a package manager for external modules
* We use packgae manager because we don't want to waste our time in creating packages from scratch, as the code is already present, which is written by someone else so just use it to save your time by incorporating it in your own project.
* NPM is bundled with node, so when we installed node then NPM got automatically installed in your system  
* Now go to terminal and first of all make sure you are in your correct directory in which you want to create your file
* Now write ``` init npm ``` and hit ``` enter ``` and it will show something like this
