# NPM 
* NPM stands for Node Package Manager, is a package manager for external modules
* We use packgae manager because we don't want to waste our time in creating packages from scratch, as the code is already present, which is written by someone else so just use it to save your time by incorporating it in your own project.
* NPM is bundled with node, so when we installed node then NPM got automatically installed in your system  
* Now go to terminal and first of all make sure you are in your correct directory in which you want to create your file
* Now write ``` init npm ``` and hit ``` enter ``` and it will show something like this

Now you'll be asked few questions for creating your package, and will be provided with suggestions also, for e.g here we can see that we have been asked for the package name and also given the suggestion of ``` 6.node.js ``` which is the name of the folder, either i can keep this name or i can change this name

Now if you are satisfied with the suggestions then hit ``` enter ``` or you can change them if you want and just leave the test commnad, git repository, and keywords for right now, will understand it later.
so now we  have this

Now you can see that a ``` package.json ``` would have been created in the atom, and you can jsut check all the description inside it, and once we will install external packages, then it will start showing in this json file

Let us say we want to install package for superhero, then just head over to npmjs.com and search for ``` superheroes ``` now you can see that, all instructions are written and how to install, how to use, as well as it is also writeen that you have to use random function in javascript to fetch the names of superheroes.

 ## *Installing the package*
 
 Just head over to terminal and make sure you are in right directory, then write ``` npm install superheroes ``` just make sure that the name of the package is case sensitive so write the exact same name as written on the npm website else it will not work.
 
 you can see that it has been installed

 Now you can see that in your package.json, in your dependecies there will be ``` superheroes version ``` that means that our project depends on a module and our module is called superheroes
 Now you can see that there are some warnings but these will be removed as soon as you will learn git/github and version control then these will be fixed and right now these are not going to effect your project.
 
 ## *writting the code*
 Now as our package is installed, so head over to index.js and write your code  for generating and printing the name of superheroes using random math function.
 For that you can just look to the document of that package at https://www.npmjs.com/package/superheroes
