What is Node.js and why Node.js
* we already know javascript and know node.js allows us to create a backend using javascript so we can use one language and we don't have to spend a lot of extra time learning about yet another language and all of its intricacies.
* Node.js is used to make your website interact with the file system of your computer, you can write javascript code not just in the browser to affect the behavior of your web sites but also to write full applications that work on your computer
* We can use node.js to run your javascript code on somebody's elses computer or server, e.g make a aquery on google.com and then our browser will make a request to google servers and on those servers we can actually execute javascript code to process their request. And after that's done we can send back the result to the user or to the client and simply get their web browser to display the information and all of that heavy lifting the code execution happens behind the scenes on the server.
