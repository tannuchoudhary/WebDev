# REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loops
* It allows you to execute code in bitechunks just like what we did with the chrome developer tools console inside Chrome We were able to write a single line of code and then hit enter and it would run that line of code and then we could run another line of code etc.

* Now to exit the repel, type
