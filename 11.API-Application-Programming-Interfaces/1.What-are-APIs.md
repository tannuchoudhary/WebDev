So an application programming interface is a set of commands functions protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.
it provides developers with standard commands for performing common operations so they don't have to write the code from scratch.
API which we have already used: jQuery, jQuery basically had a whole bunch of functions and methods that allowed us to create software. And it made it so much quicker to perform a whole bunch of things using javascript in the DOM by using these special methods. So this is a form of API that developers use to create software.
