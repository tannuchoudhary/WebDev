So an application programming interface is a set of commands functions protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

it provides developers with standard commands for performing common operations so they don't have to write the code from scratch.

API which we have already used: jQuery, jQuery basically had a whole bunch of functions and methods that allowed us to create software. And it made it so much quicker to perform a whole bunch of things using javascript in the DOM by using these special methods. So this is a form of API that developers use to create software.

Till now our Web sites have only been able to make requests to our server.And these are get requests and in return our server sends back a response. And that includes all of the HTML, CSS and Javascript files that requires()  in order to render a Web site.

Now what if for our Web site we wanted information from Facebook's servers. Well in that case what we actually need to do is we need to make a request from our server to somebody else's server. Let us say I am creating tinder app and i want data from Facebook, therefore we will make a request from our server to Facebook's server and Facebook will send a response back with all of that data that we need in order to populate our website. And this is one of the most common ways of using APIs which is to interact with an external source.

![API3](https://github.com/tannuchoudhary/WebDev/blob/main/Images/api3.png)
Now we can't just go into somebody else's server and make a request. we have to do it through the API the application programming interface and this interface will determine what all the things that we can request from their server and how should we do it.

![API4](https://github.com/tannuchoudhary/WebDev/blob/main/Images/api4.png)
So it's kind of almost a bit like a menu. For example if we were trying to tap into the API of a website that has data on crypto currencies then that API menu might include things like, you get the price of bitcoin you get the price of a Ethereum.You get the price of other crypto currencies and we can choose based off this menu or this API documentation.

* when you type a new command in your terminal, you can first write man in from of it, it will give you manual of that command ``` man curl ```, if you have never seen that command than man will give u a big hint about what you can do with this command.


Now for e.g you can go to bitcoinaverage.com and then go to the API and documentation, you'll be redirected to [here](https://apiv2.bitcoinaverage.com/#ticker-data-all), then just check that how you can make http request, then you can see that the first thing mentioned here is curl, now curl is a way of making an http request through the command line, curl is simply a client for URL or it's simply a way for us to interact with a URL on the command line.
