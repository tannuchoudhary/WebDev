# Using the Request Module to Get Data from an API
*We are going to create a project using API, we'll use it to grab live data from external sources and use it in our website. So we are going to grab live Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency data and we're going to make a web site that allows users to check the latest prices of their cryptocurrency.*

## Some things you need to do before creating any project
* Make a directory ``` mkdir Bitcoin-Ticker ```
* cd into the directory ``` cd Bitcoin-Ticker ```
* Create two files named index.js and index.html ``` touch index.js index.html ```
* Initialize npm and create json file ``` npm init ```
* Install 2 packages, express and body parser ``` npm install express body-parser ```, express for writting express codes and body-parser to use variables and objects in web page. and you can install more than 1 package if you have space between them just like I did above.
* Open atom and set up your project, i.e, require everything
* require express and body parser 
  ```javascript 
     const express = require("express");
     const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
  ```
* comment ``` //jshint esversion: 6 ``` to remove warnings
* initialize app ``` const app = express(); ```
*
