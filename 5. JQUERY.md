# jQuery Notes:

* We need to write so many lines of code to do a simple task in javascript but with the help of jQuery we can minimize  the effort
* jQuery was built by John Resig in 2006 to convert long javascript codes into short and sweet codes.
Now the code which was written like this:
```javascript
document.querySelector("h1")
```
we were looking through the DOM of our Web site we're selecting the document and we're clearing for the Selecter H-1, So we're looking for the one element in our web page, Now if we were to use the J query library then we can get rid of all of that, i.e

```javascript
jQuery("h1")
```
we can make it even simpler by using $, i.e

```javascript
$("h1")
```
and this will work same as ```javascript document.querySelector("h1") ```

* so jQuery makes our codes lot easier to read, lot faster to write and lot easier to debug 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to use jQuery, we have to attach it, either we can download it or just attach the CDN for jQuery library i.e the link just like we used to do in bootstarp, so we'll just attach the link before the javascript source in HTML code

it is better to use google hosted libraries as google is the most famous so it is likely to be supported in everyone's system
so we will jsut attach the script tag of jQuery above the javascript tag in HTML code, the positioning is very important as the code will run from top to bottom, so if you'll place below the javascript code then it will not recognize the jQuery codes written in javascript

so remember to put:
* css script in the head section
* js script at the last, just before closing the body
* jquery script just before the js script

So there is one way which you can safeguard it for the error that you might have defined the jquery in head section, i.e the website will try to modify the styles and HTML before even it is declare so to add safeguard you can write this before the jQuery code, which will check whether our jQuery library is ready or not 

```javascript
//this function will only call the code once the document is ready
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("h1").css("color", "red");
});
```
but you don't need to do this if you will add the jQuery script at end of the code i.e just before the closing tag of the body
