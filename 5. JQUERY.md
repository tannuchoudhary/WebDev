# jQuery Notes:

* We need to write so many lines of code to do a simple task in javascript but with the help of jQuery we can minimize  the effort
* jQuery was built by John Resig in 2006 to convert long javascript codes into short and sweet codes.
Now the code which was written like this:
```javascript
document.querySelector("h1")
```
we were looking through the DOM of our Web site we're selecting the document and we're clearing for the Selecter H-1, So we're looking for the one element in our web page, Now if we were to use the J query library then we can get rid of all of that, i.e

```javascript
jQuery("h1")
```
we can make it even simpler by using $, i.e

```javascript
$("h1")
```
and this will work same as ```javascript document.querySelector("h1") ```

* so jQuery makes our codes lot easier to read, lot faster to write and lot easier to debug

Now to use jQuery, we have to attach it, either we can download it or just attach the CDN i.e the link just like we used to do in bootstarp, so we'll just attach the link before the javascript source in HTML code
