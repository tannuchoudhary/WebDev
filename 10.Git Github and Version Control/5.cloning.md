* Let us see how to clone a remote repository to pull it into your local machine, this is a way for you to pull down all of the commits and all of the versions of a particular remote repository and to store the files inside your working directory, this is called cloning, and the command is ``` git clone ```

 * Previously when we learned how to use other's code, we generally go to someone's repository and download the zip and then extract it in out folder, but now we will clone it using terminal in our system.
 * copy the URL present at the right up of the repository which you will get after clicking on download, now  write git clone and paste the command, for e.g here I am cloning a game swift-2048 ``` git clone https://github.com/austinzheng/swift-2048.git ```
 * Now the repository is cloned in your local directory
 * Now once you have cloned a project, now you can cd into it using ``` cd swift-2048 ``` and using the ``` git log ``` you can check out the previous commits and commit messages and you can see what each commit is all about.
