The reason why the pull request is called a pull request and not a push request is because the person who has the right permission to the repository has the deciding vote.


So I can review the changes and I can pull the changes over. So its not a push because you don't own the rights to the remote repository that you're trying to push to.In this case if I decide after code review that those features actually added were pretty great. And it seems compatible with my code so far and doesn't break anything than I would approve the pull request and merge the repository with my own. So the changes will be reflected in a new commit.
