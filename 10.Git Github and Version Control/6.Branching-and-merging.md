Sometimes we just want to try out something different, maybe build a new feature or just to mess around with a new idea or concept. So what we can do is instead of continuing to commit to the master branch which is the main branch, we can also create a side branch so we can create as many branches as we like. Now simultaneously we can continue working on the main branch putting out all those essential updates or bits of code that are maintaining our main project but at the same time we can continue to update and work on this experimental branch trying things out and committing our experiments to this experimental branch.


So now we have two branches that are parallel to each other and they can be developed simultaneously.Now if at some point in the future that we decide that that experiment was really fruitful and the feature that we built in it was really really great and we'd like to merge it back to the main branch or to the main project then that can be done really easily as well by simply placing a merge request in. And we can bring all of those changes that we experimented with that we messed around with back to the main project and check to see if there's any conflict with the main branch code.


And if not or if after a little bit of editing then we can bring all of those changes into the main working master branch and then we can continue working from here on to the next commit or we can make more branches and very often what you see in practice is that there'll be multiple branches being worked on at the same time for any given large project.


And the reason is because sometimes you are developing new features sometimes you are fixing bugs and all of these things may break your main project so you don't want to do it on the master branch. You only want to put it onto the master branch once you've tested, once you know that everything is working fine and then you can bring your code back to the working copy ready for shipment and deployment.

## *Let us see how we'll do this*
We are going to use our previously created repo story for this
* ``` git branch alien-plot ``` git branch will create a branch and you have to name the branch, you can name it anything, I named it the alien-plot
* you can check out, which branch you are in by just writting ``` git branch ```, here you can see that you've got 1 branch called alien-plot and 1 branch called master and asterisk shows that which branch you are currently on, so you are on the master branch.
* Now you can move to the branch alien-plot by just writting ``` git checkout alien-plot ```, now you have switched to the branch called alien-plot
* Now in this branch let us make some changes in your files, change whatever you want in your files.
* Now after changing the content inside the files, do ``` git add .```
* Now do ``` git commit -m "Modify chapter 1 and 2 to have alien theme```  
* Now you can hit ``` git log ``` to see that you have two commits in the master branch
* Now I want to move to my master branch, you know that you can check out in which branch you are currently on by clicking ``` git branch ```, you can see that asterisk is on alien-plot so you are on alien-plot so you can move to the master branch by ``` git checkout master ```
* Now you can see that nothing has chnaged in your master branch
* Now create one more file in your master branch ```touch chapter4.txt ``` and write some content inside the chapter4.txt using ``` nano chapter4.txt ``` and then do ``` git add . ``` and then ``` git commit -m "add chapter 4" ```now you can see the logs using ``` git log ``` you can see the commits of the local repository as well as remote repository 
* Now if you will switch branches using ``` git checkout alien-plot ``` then you can see that your local files got changed when you changed the branch because right now we haven't declared chapter4.txt in the new branch.
* Now I found out that the changes which i've made in another branch i.e alien-plot are good and can be merged with the master branch, then first of all move to the master branch using ``` git checkout master ``` then to merge you have to write command ``` git merge alien-plot ``` after writting git merge, you have to specify the branch name you want to merge and 
* Now your alien-plot branch is merged with master branch and now you can push these changes to the remote repository ``` git push origin master -u ```
