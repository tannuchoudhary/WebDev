# Ignore secret files while committing all files
* Make a directory called project: ```mkdir Project ```
* cd into the Project directory ``` cd Project ```
* Create 3 files: ``` touch file1.txt ```, ``` touch file2.txt ```, ``` touch file3.txt ```
* Create a file called, secrets.txt ``` touch secrets.txt ```
* Let us say this secrets.txt file contains passwords, API keys or anything which you don't want to be committed especially you don't want it to be hosted on an open platform like github.
* Another type of file that you might want to add in a gitignore or you might want to not upload to github files that are to do with your local settings or your user preferences.

So a really common example that people tend to add to their gitignore files are DS store files, DS store files are basically a setting's file that saves certain things like, how you like your icons be arranged in a particular project folder.
* so we have to create gitignore file by ``` touch .gitignore ```
* And by opening this file in gedit, you can save the file names which you want to ignore while comitting
* do ``` git init ``` to initialize empty git repository locally
* ``` git add . ``` to add everything in staging area
* ``` git status ``` to check git status
* but you can see that .DS_store and secrets.txt is also added in the staging area, bu ti don't want to add it
* use ``` git rm --cached -r . ``` rm for remove, -r for recursive and the dot(.) represents all files, this command will just undo the last process i.e will remove all the files from the staging area.
* So we'll add all the file names in gitignore which we don't want to commit, So in order to add the individual files, you can simply specify the file name on each and every new line, so open the gitignore and mention the file name like .DS_store and secrets.txt in each new line, you can use # sign to comment in the gitignore files and also you can use asterisk, i.e, if you will use ``` *.txt ``` then it will consider all the files with txt extension to not commit.
* now commit this as your initial commit using ``` git commit -m "Initial commit" ``` then only the four files, i.e, file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt and .gitignore will be committed and rest i.e, secrets.txt and DS_store will not be committed.
