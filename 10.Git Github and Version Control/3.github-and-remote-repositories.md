* Create a repository, set name and description, in my case name is "Story" and description is "My Masterpiece"
* Don't add readme, and create repo
* They will tell you that you can use command line to setup your repository
* So we are going to push an existing repository that we've got locally onto this remote repository and we are going to use those lines which are mentioned to transfer or push our existing library. These are

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:tannuchoudhary/Story.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

```

# How to push local repository to remote repository

* Create a remote``` git remote add origin git@github.com:tannuchoudhary/Story.git ``` origin word is used by convention, you can use anything, and then paste the link you got on github after creating repository
* Push local repository onto your remote repository which is called origin ```git push -u origin master ```, this pushes the local repsoitory to remote repository using the  -u flag or u option which basically links up your remote to the local repository and then we're going to push it towards the remote that's called Origin and we're going to push it to the branch that's called Master.So the master branch is simply the default branch or the main branch of all of your commits.
