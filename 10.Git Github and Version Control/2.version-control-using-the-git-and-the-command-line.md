# How to create repositiory and commit using command line

* First of all cd into your desktop: ``` cd Desktop ```
* Create a new folder called story: ``` mkdir story ```
* Create a new file called chapter1.txt: ``` touch story ```
* Write some content into that file using nano``` nano chapter1.txt ``` or you can open it using text editor using ``` gedit chapter1.txt ```
* Save the content in nano using ``` ctrl+x ```and exit
* Create a git local repository and start tracking some of the file changes, to initialize git: ``` git init ```, git is going to be used to track all your changes, to commit your changes and perform version control.
* Currently you are inside the working directory which is the ``` story directory ```
* In order to just start tracking the changes of my files. For example chapter1.txt then I need to add this file to a staging area and staging area is basically a intermediate place where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory you want to commit. to see what's currently inside my staging area we can use the ``` git status ``` command and it shows us that there are untracked files which will be shown in red and this is something that is simply inside my working directory.
* Now you can see that chapter1.txt is in red color, that means it is yet not in staging area and to add it in staging area and to start tracking changes in it I have to use the command ``` git add filename ``` which in our case would be ``` git add chapter1.txt ```
* Now hit enter and now if you will try to see the git status using ``` git status ``` then you can see that chapter1.txt file is now added as new file, that does mean it is in staging area and it is ready to be committed.
* Now commit this file under version control using ``` git commit -m "Complete chapter 1"```, we are using -m for message, this is really important part, it is something that helps you keep track of what changes you have made in each commit. So when you create a new save point you want to be as explicit as possible about what changes were made between the last save point and this current save point.

So for our initial commit we can use something very simple like "Initial commit" and this shows that this is our starting point, or we can use "Complete chapter 1". Note that writting commit messages in present tense is the best practice.

Let us go hit enter, now this is our first commit

* You can check what commits you have made using ``` git log ```, here it will show what commits you have made amd at which time and also there is a # which uniquely identifies this particular commit, and then at the end you can see the commit message.
* Now let us create two more chapters called ``` chapter2.txt ``` and ``` chapter3.txt ``` and now edit and add content to them using ``` nano chapter2.txt ``` and ``` nano chapter3.txt ``` 
* Use ``` git status ``` and you will see that these two files ares till untracked and now to add these two new files in the staging area, we can use  ``` git add chapter2.txt ``` and then ``` chapter3.txt ``` but what if there are so many files, you are not going to do this for all the files, so here is the alternative, use ``` git add . ``` to specify everything in this story directory
* Now type ``` git status ``` then you can see that these two files has been added to the staging area.
* Now commit these files using ``` git commit -m "Complete chapter 2 and 3"
* Now you can check history using ``` git log ```, we can see that we have two commits both with different hashes because they are different and unique.
* Now let us see what we have done till now

so we created a file in our working directory inside our story directory. So the working directory is the folder or the directory where you initialize your git repository. When we said ``` git init ``` we did that inside the story directory. So that becomes a working directory.And from now on it is going to try and track the changes that it sees between the working directory and the local repository.So in the beginning we created a file inside our working directory inside story and then we used it to add to push it to the staging area.

Now the reason why there is this intermediate staging area because you might wonder why not just go from the working directory straight to the repository. Why do we need this extra step. Well sometimes you might not want to add all of your files to be tracked or all of your files to be committed. So the staging area is a good place to try and figure out what are the things that you want to ignore. And one of the things that you want to be tracked. So once we've used it and we've put all file into the staging area and we're happy with the changes that we are going to commit then the next step is to go ahead and committed using the ```git commit``` command.

So now our file is inside our local repository and that version is given a name through the commit message.

![git4](https://github.com/tannuchoudhary/WebDev/blob/main/Images/git4.png)

So that means that even if we've messed up our file we can still use the last version that's under version control and we can use a special command called ``` git checkout ``` to revert back all rollback to the last position in our local repository.

* Now let us use this practically, go to ``` nano chapter3.txt ``` and modify the text inside it and now check the ``` git status ``` you can see that the data is modified in chapter3.txt and it is not committed yet, now we have done a blunder in chapter3.txt and we want to revert back to the previous code.
* You can see the difference between the changed code and previous code using command, ``` git diff `filename``` i.e ``` git diff chapter3.txt ```
* And to moveback to your last committed file, use ``` git checkout filename ``` i.e ``` git checkout chapter3.txt```

## this was the local implementation of git, so we are saving these versions on our computer locally.
