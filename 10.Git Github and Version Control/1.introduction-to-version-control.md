# What is version control

When we write a code, we generally modify it after sometime. for e.g let us say you wrote a code for something, now this is the ``` version 1 ``` of your code, after few days you wanted to add few more functionalities in your code so you added some more code into your prewritten code, so now this is the ``` version 2 ``` of your code. Now again you wanted to add few more functionalities in your code, now after adding the code, this will become ``` version 3 ``` of your code, now let us assume that may be your file crashed or you deleted the file accidently or something happened yo your file, then you can always go to the previous version of the file and not only the previous version but youc an go as many versions back as you want. so You can go as far back or as far forwards as you like as long as you know which version you want.
